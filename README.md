This is a simple shiny app that allows to view annual mean wages on powiat (county) level in Poland.

The data for wages come from GUS Bank Lokalny and the geographical data on counties from GIS support Bank wiedzy.

So far the app has a map of all counties with their annual mean wages and a table that shows changes in wages from 2002 to 2023

Issues & TO DOs:
- redo the table: some information now is redundant. Make it year-level (e.g. percentile etc?)
- change the text display: make it a bit bigger, add more explanations
- remake the layout? Make more text and explanations
